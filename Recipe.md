 While the basmati rice is soaking, use that time to prep the other ingredients. First, you will want to rinse, peel and chop all of the veggies. This will make the process of cooking go by much quicker.

What to use: I have used 3 cups mixed veggies including green peas. You can use your choice of mixed vegetables for your veg dum biryani.

Onion: Slice 1 large onion thinly (about 1 heaped cup thinly sliced onion).
Ginger: Finely chop or crush 10 grams ginger (2 pieces of 2 inch ginger or 1.5 tablespoons finely chopped ginger). You should get 1 tablespoon of ginger paste.
Garlic: Finely chop or crush 5 grams garlic (10 to 12 medium garlic cloves or 1 tablespoon finely chopped garlic). You will need ½ tablespoon garlic paste.
Chilies: Slit 3 to 4 green chilies.
Cilantro: Chop coriander leaves (cilantro) and mint leaves. You should get ⅓ cup each of chopped coriander leaves and mint leaves.

Cook the Rice
4. After you have organized and chopped all of your vegetables, it is time to cook the basmati rice. You can use any method to cook your rice – microwave, pressure cooking, instant pot or cooking in a pot.


If cooking your rice in a pot, use a deep bottomed pan and add 5 cups water.

Add Spices to Boiling Water
5. When the water is hot, add all the spices and 1 teaspoon salt. Here’s what you want to include for your veg dum biryani in this step:

1 tej patta
3 green cardamoms
3 cloves
1 black cardamom
1 inch true cinnamon or 1 inch cassia cinnamon
2 single strands of mace

8. Gently stir with a spoon or fork after you add the soaked basmati rice. Check the taste of water and ensure it is slightly salty.

TIP: If the water is not tasting slightly salty, then add some more salt.

9. Do not reduce the heat and continue to cook the rice grains.

Don’t Fully Cook the Rice
10. The rice should not be fully cooked, but a bit undercooked or about 75% or ¾ of the way cooked.

TIP: Taste the rice! The grains should still have a slight bite to them.

11. Drain the semi-cooked rice in a colander. You can also rinse them gently with water so that the grains stop cooking.

Make Vegetable Gravy
12. In a 2-litre pressure cooker or a pan, heat 3 tablespoons of ghee, then add the following spices. Sauté the whole spices until they crackle. You can make the vegetable gravy in a pan as well.

Cook the Vegetables
25. Pressure cook for 1 whistle or 3 to 4 minutes on medium heat. If cooking in a pot, then cook until the veggies are done. Don’t overcook the vegetables.

26. When the pressure settles down on its own, remove the lid and check the gravy.

If the vegetables are not cooked well, then keep the pressure cooker on the stove top and simmer the vegetable biryani gravy without the lid, till the vegetables are tender.
If there is too much water or stock in the gravy, then simmer till some water dries up. The vegetable gravy should have a medium or slightly thick consistency and should not be watery.

27. Add 2 tablespoons cashews, 1 tablespoons raisins and 2 tablespoons almonds (blanched or raw) to the vegetable gravy.

TIP: Do check the salt and add more if required. You can chop the nuts before adding.

TIP: If you’d like, you can even add ⅓ to ½ cup of golden fried onions (birista) if you have these. You can make 2 layers or 4 layers like I have done. But do remember that rice should be the top layer and the vegetable gravy should be the bottom layer.

40. Take a tawa (griddle/skillet) and heat it on medium heat. You can begin to preheat the tava when you start assembling the hyderabadi veg biryani.

Lower the heat when the skillet becomes hot, and keep the sealed veg biryani pan on the tawa. Keep the flame to the lowest and cook for 30 to 35 minutes.

TIP: You can also dum cook veg biryani for the first 15 minutes on direct low flame and then for the last 10 minutes, place the pan on the hot tawa or skillet and cook on a low flame.

Method 3 – Baking
41. Preheat the oven to 180 degree celsius for 15 minutes and then bake the vegetable biryani in a preheated oven for 30 to 40 minutes.

Remember to use an oven safe glass bowl or casserole dish like the pyrex bowl or use a dutch oven.

You have to assemble the vegetable biryani as mentioned above in the casserole dish or your dutch oven. Seal tightly with aluminium foil or an oven safe heat resistant lid and then bake.

Check Cooked Biryani
42. After 30 to 25 minutes, switch off the flame, and use a fork or spoon check the bottom layer of the biryani. There should be no liquids at the bottom.

If there are liquids, then continue to dum cook. After dum cooking, give a resting time of 5 to 7 minutes and later serve hyderabadi veg biryani.

While serving the veg dum biryani, make sure you equally serve the vegetables as well as rice layers.

What do you eat with Veg Biryani
There are various sides that pair best with a veg biryani. Biryani is usually accompanied with a raita (yogurt dip). The raita can be a simple onion raita or made with a mix of onion, tomatoes and cucumber.

While we personally love Cucumber Raita, Onion Tomato Raita and Boondi Raita, you could enjoy biryani with any savory raita of your liking.

You can also pair it with Kachumber Salad (onion-tomato salad), plain Curd (Yogurt), Mango Pickle, some lemon wedges or roasted papad.

The Hyderabadi veg biryani is usually served with Mirchi ka Salan (Green Chilly Curry) and raita. If desired you can serve biryani with a simple soupy Shorba gravy.

You can also enjoy veg biryani as it is without any sides or accompaniments.

Storage
Store the biryani leftovers in your refrigerator for a day only. While reheating steam for 5 minutes in a pan or Instant pot. You could even lightly sauté the veg biryani stirring frequently in a frying pan or skillet until warm or hot.

Tips
Expert Tips
Ingredient Notes and Variations
Rice: To make a biryani firstly you need good quality basmati rice – preferably aged basmati rice. Biryani is not mushy and the rice grains remain perfectly separate in the dish. For this recipe I included aged basmati rice.
Sella Basmati Rice: I also make biryani with parboiled basmati rice (known as sella basmati rice in Hindi and converted basmati rice outside India) and it works wonderfully and much better than aged basmati rice. Biryani made with sella basmati rice has restaurant style flavors as many hotels and restaurants in India use this rice for making biryani as well as other rice based dishes like Pulao, Fried Rice and Jeera Rice (cumin rice).
Cooking of rice: The rice grains are boiled until they are ¾ cooked. They will have a slight bite to them and will be slightly undercooked. Do not cook the rice 100% as then they will become mushy by the time the biryani is dum cooked.
Spices: The lovely fragrance and aroma in a biryani comes from using whole spices. Thus the spices need to be fresh and in good condition.
Curd (Yogurt): The vegetable curry is made with yogurt and so it is important that the yogurt must be fresh and not sour. The curd or yogurt should also be made from whole milk. Do not use fat free yogurt or curd made from toned milk as it will split while cooking.
Biryani gravy: The curry or gravy for the veg biryani should have a medium to medium-thick consistency. It should not be watery like a stock or broth as this will lead to the rice becoming mushy or very soft after dum cooking.
Vegan variation: Use almond milk yogurt or cashew milk yogurt. Replace ghee (clarified butter) with oil. You could use any vegetable oil or neutral tasting oil.
More Info
One-pot biryani: Though mostly biryani is layered and cooked there are several one-pot biryani dishes, specifically in the southern parts of India where the biryani is cooked much like the way a pulao is made by adding all the ingredients in a pot and dum cooking them.
Proteins: Biryani, though usually made with meat is also made with seafood, eggs, paneer (cottage cheese), mushrooms and vegetables. In some versions of biryani, the curry or gravy is made with both eggs and vegetables or meat and vegetables.
Spices: The spices, aromatics, flavoring ingredients also differ widely from state to state in India. Example in South India you will see the addition of curry leaves, black pepper, coconut milk, cilantro etc. So no two biryani dishes will taste the same.
Biryani Masala: Sometimes biryani is made using a special type of ground spice blend known as the Biryani Masala. This spice blend is made by grinding whole spices that are usually added to a biryani.In this recipe you don’t need to add biryani masala. Just the whole spices are enough.
FAQs
What can I garnish the veg biryani with?
In some variations, the semi-cooked rice or curry layers are topped with fried onions (also known birista) and fragrant ingredients like rose water, pandanus extract (kewra water) and saffron infused milk, ghee (clarified butter) are also sprinkled from the top.

Herbs like coriander leaves and mint are additional garnishes that bring in a bright pop of flavor and color.

What is dum pukht biryani?
Any biryani cooked with the method of dum cooking is a dum pukht biryani. It is made by making separate layers of the par-cooked rice and gravy. This entire assembly of the semi-cooked rice and gravy with the various toppings, garnishings are sealed tightly in a clay pot and then slow cooked on low heat.

Authentically and traditionally a biryani is always slow cooked on dum. This cooking on dum gives the biriyani its uniqueness and originality. This is how the biryani has the beautiful medley of the aromas, flavors and tastes from the variety of ingredients added in it. This hyderabadi veg biryani recipe is also a vegetarian dum pukht biryani.

How is traditional biryani made?
In the Indian Cuisine, specifically in the North Indian cuisine, the traditional biryani is made with the dum pukht method of slow cooking in clay pots (also known as “handi” in India).

Of course nowadays many home cooks even bake biryani in the oven. In the step by step process shots above, I have explained both the dum cooking and oven baking methods – so that you can choose what suits you.

Instructions
Soaking Rice
Pick and rinse basmati rice in running water till the water runs clear of starch. Soak the rice in 1 cup of water for 30 minutes.
After 30 minutes drain the rice and set aside.
When the rice is soaking prep all the veggies and other ingredients. Set aside.
Cooking Rice

Take a deep bottomed pan. Add water and heat the water on a high flame.
When the water becomes hot, add the salt and following spices: tej patta, green cardamoms, cloves, black cardamom, cinnamon, strands of mace.
Bring the water to a boil. Then add the soaked basmati rice.
Just gently stir with a spoon or fork, after you add the soaked rice.
Do not reduce the flame and continue to cook the rice grains.
The rice has to be ¾ᵗʰ cooked. The grains should have a slight bite to them when cooked. The rice should not be fully cooked.
Drain the rice in a colander. Gently fluff and keep aside.
Making Vegetable Curry/Gravy
In a 2-litre pressure cooker or a pan, heat ghee. Add the following spices – shahjeera, tej patta, green cardamoms, cloves, black cardamom and cinnamon. Sauté the whole spices till they crackle.
Now add the onions. Stir and sauté them on a low to medium flame.
Add a pinch of salt to quicken the cooking process.
When the onions are cooking, take 1 cup fresh curd (yogurt) in a bowl and whisk the curd with a spoon or wired whisk till it become smooth.
Sauté the onions till they become golden brown or caramelize.
Then add the ginger-garlic paste and sliced green chillies. You can also finely chop the ginger-garlic and add.
Sauté till the raw aroma of ginger-garlic goes away.
Add the turmeric and red chili powder. Stir and mix well.
Next add the chopped veggies. Sauté for a minute or two.
Lower the heat and add the whisked curd (yogurt). Stir and mix well as soon as you add the curd. Then add ½ cup water in the pressure cooker. For cooking in a pan, add ¾ cup water.
Season with salt and mix again.
Pressure cook for 1 whistle on 3 to 4 minutes on medium heat. If cooking in a pot, then cook until the vegetables are tender. Don’t over cook the vegetables.
Warm 4 to 5 tablespoons milk in a microwave or in a small pan on the stove top. Add ¼ teaspoon of saffron strands. Stir and keep aside.
When the pressure settles down on its own, remove the lid and check the gravy.
If the vegetables are under cooked, then keep the cooker on the stove top and simmer the vegetable biryani gravy without the lid, till the vegetables are tender.
If there is too much of water or stock in the gravy, then simmer until some of the water evaporates and dries up. Note that the vegetable gravy should have a medium or slightly thick consistency and should not be watery.
Now add cashews, raisins and almonds (blanched or raw) to the vegetable gravy. Mix and stir. Set aside. Do a taste test and check the salt in the vegetable gravy. Add more if needed.

Sprinkle half of the chopped coriander leaves (cilantro), mint leaves and saffron milk.
Layer the remaining vegetable gravy.
Layer the last portion of the rice. Sprinkle the remaining coriander leaves, mint leaves, and saffron infused milk on the top. Sprinkle rose water or kewra water.
You can make 2 layers or 4 layers like I have done. But do note that rice should be the top layer and the vegetable gravy should be the bottom layer.

Recipe Notes and Variations
Ingredients: Do try to use all the ingredients as mentioned in the recipe.
Rice:  Use a good quality basmati rice – preferably aged basmati rice. You can even use Sella Basmati Rice which is parboiled basmati rice (known as sella basmati rice in Hindi and converted basmati rice outside India). For sella basmati rice, you will need to soak the rice grains for an hour. The cooking time will also increase for this variety of basmati rice.

Hello mam ,
I tried your biriyani recipe in 2014 and since then doing it. It has been awesome everytime. Wholehearted thanks to you and your recipe 🥰. I have a doubt now. Due to time constraint in recent times , i am asking this – can we prepare the biriyani gravy the previous night refrigerat it and then can we cook the rice and dum process next day along with tat gravy ?

Dassana Amit
Aug 10, 2020 at 11:40 pm
Thank you for the feedback. Yes, you can make the gravy a day before and refrigerate it and layer & dum cook the next day. If gravy looks thick after refrigeration, then just add about 2 to 3 tablespoons of water in the gravy and mix well.

Hi Dassana,

We tried this veg Biryani as per exact proportion per your recipe and it turned out very tasty and delicious. We used Chulha for cooking. It was too good.
Thanks for sharing such recipe.Keep it up!!
I do not find use of biryani masala in recipe. I cooked Biryani with readymade biryani masala. It was very tasty.

Jul 24, 2020 at 8:05 pm
Hi Ram, thank you for the feedback. The smoky flavors from the chulha must have made the biryani very tasty. In this recipe biryani masala is not added, but you can add it and it will give a nice taste to the biryani. Welcome and happy cooking.
